# Library System
This project is made with the focus on using advanced database and test concepts. The focus has been on developing different test cases and documenting every test to be made, to ensure the traceability from requirements, to documentation, to code - and reverse.
There is not going to be put effort into the coding, since this is focused on more advanced concepts, such as:

* Database Indexes
* Advanced Queries
* Triggers and Stored Procedures
* Black Box Testing
* White Box Testing
* Test Traceability

The scripts for the MSSQL can be seen in the 'db_scripts' folder.
